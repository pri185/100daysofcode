Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {

        if(num==1){

        return 1;
        }

        int start = 1;

        int end = num/2;

        while(start<=end){

            long long mid = start +(end-start)/2;

            if(mid * mid == num)

            return 1;

            else if(mid * mid > num)
            end = mid - 1;

            else start = mid + 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
