 (P/1)Divide Two Integers
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

class Solution
{
public:
	int divide(int dividend, int divisor)
	{
		int result;
		//different cases:-
		if (dividend >= INT_MAX && divisor == 1)	
		result = INT_MAX;

		else if(dividend <= INT_MIN && divisor == 1)
		 result = INT_MIN;

		else if(dividend <= INT_MIN && divisor == -1) 
		result = abs(INT_MAX);

		else result  = dividend / divisor;
    	return result;
	}
};
